# Code Review

Help review code for bugs, style issues, and improvements.

## Usage

Ask me to review code by sharing it or pointing to files.

## Capabilities

- Find potential bugs
- Check for security issues
- Suggest improvements
- Verify best practices

## How to Review

When reviewing code, I will:

1. **Read the code** using `read_file` to understand the implementation
2. **Analyze** for common issues:
   - Logic errors and edge cases
   - Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
   - Performance concerns
   - Code style and readability
   - Missing error handling
3. **Provide feedback** with specific suggestions and examples

## Example Prompts

- "Review the code in ~/project/main.go"
- "Check this function for bugs: [paste code]"
- "Is this code secure? [paste code]"
- "How can I improve this implementation?"

## Tools

- `read_file`: Read source files for review
- `list_dir`: Explore project structure
- `exec`: Run linters or tests if needed
